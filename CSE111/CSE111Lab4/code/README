DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------
This project implements a client server application, 
mainly using sockets. A majority of the code has been
provided by Professor Mackey, but files that have been 
changed include:
- cxi.cpp
- cxid.cpp

Functions that have been added to these files include 
implementations of RM, GET, and PUT.

All of the code modified by me is located in the files
listed above.
I have read and understood the UC Santa Cruz
